                <p>A quick disclaimer about go|io:<br /><br />
                   THIS SITE WILL NOT ACTUALLY ALLOW YOU TO BOOK A FLIGHT<br /><br /><br />
                   It will, however, allow you to see real search results in real-time,<br />
                   and so if you see a flight on go|io, you can be sure that it is, in fact,<br />
                   available at the price shown.<br /><br />
                   Because we use Google tech, we suggest heading over to<br />
                   <a href="https://flights.google.com">flights.google.com</a> to book.<br />
                   There you will find the same flight for the same price.<br /><br /><br />
                   Thank you for using this service, happy flying!
